Hey, I’m a frontend developer whose day job is building modern web experiences in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) environments. Outside of work, I can be found experimenting with CAD, 3D scanning and printing, and microcontroller projects—usually with more whimsy than usefulness. This blog is a space for documenting personal builds, sharing development insights, and exploring the overlap between software, hardware, and design.
