Hey, I’m a JavaScript developer who loves building things that are useful, efficient, and maybe a little whimsicle. This blog is where I document projects I'm working on, share tutorials, and explore whatever technical rabbit hole I’ve most recently fallen into. I’m especially into clean systems, thoughtful UX, and learning out loud. If you're into practical dev workflows, weird hardware experiments, or just trying to write better code, you’re in the right place.
